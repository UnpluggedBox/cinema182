# Cinema 182
Finals project from 2019

Made with Java + PHPMyAdmin/MySQL

As this is an old project, there'll be no documentation/explanation of the code in this readme.
There are still lots of unimplemented feature that will never be finished. There wasn't enough time to finish what I envisioned for this project at the start.

I'm uploading this just to show my work for my resume.
